## bf2mods

Some mod code by @modeco80 and @BlockBuilder57 (and partially @3096) for Xenoblade 2.

## Build Instructions

Install devKitPro with Switch development features.

Clone this repository with --recursive.

Run `make`.

...

Profit! (patch-bf2 directory in skyline/ will contain things needed to be installed)

## Installation instructions (LayeredFS)

In /atmosphere/contents/<BF2_TITLE_ID>/ make a exefs directory. In there, place the 2.0.0 ExeFS.

Once you've done that, simply place all the files from the skyline/patch-bf2 directory into the exefs directory (overwriting any conflicts).. and tada!

## Credits

All the Skyline peeps (sorry we couldn't do anything nicer, but at least document your plugin code lol)

3096 for the initial ether repository (and for helping as well)
