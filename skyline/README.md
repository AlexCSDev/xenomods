##Skyline
An environment for linking, runtime hooking and code patching in ~~Super Smash Bros Ultimate~~ Xenoblade ~~DE~~ 2 and DE. probably. idk. ask jeeves

this "fork" inside of the bf2mods repository is mainly used for bf2mods' hooking and "plugins" and has most of the official Skyline plugin code cut off.
Also reformatted because I can't stand it. sorry
