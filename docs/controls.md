## Controls

Xenomods mostly utilizes a menu to interact with the game, as most buttons are already taken up on the controller. A few specific things like moonjump and event debugging are notable exceptions to this.

#### P1 controls:

#### Camera controls:

The camera can be controlled by P1 while the Menu is open, but ideally should be used by P2 so both analog sticks are always free.
